# Create-New-Hedera-Accounts-and-Generate-Keys-for-the-NFT
Let's create additional Hedera accounts to represent users for this scenario, such as the Treasury, Alice, and Bob. These accounts are created using your Testnet account credentials from the Hedera portal (see the resources for getting started). Account creation starts by generating a private key for the new account and then calling a reusable function (accountCreatorFcn) that uses the new key, an initial balance, and the Hedera client. You can easily reuse this function if you need to create more accounts in the future.
